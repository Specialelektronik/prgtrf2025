# Actual files that are relevant:
#
# *.umc		SIMPL module source files
# *.usp		SIMPL+ module source files.
# 		When temp files are deleted, these files should be
#		opened and compiled before UMC or SMW files.
# *.ir		IR source files for devices.
# *.pdf		Documentation for the modules and should stay with
# 		the .UMC files.
# *.smw		Main project files.

# SIMPL+ ignored files
#
# Strictly speaking, *.ush files are generated files. However, these files
# are routinely distributed as part of packages from vendors. Probably best
# to just keep these as tracked files.
#
# Also, these need to be compiled prior to SIMPL files. By just tracking
# these, the compile process is much easier.
